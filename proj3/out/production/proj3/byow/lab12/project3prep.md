# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: The way that I was trying to do it was trying to do multiple things at once. The lab solution really
broke things down even further, even the smallest thing had a separate method. 

-----

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: They are all going to be combined / connected together. On the project 3 side we are going to have
hallways and rooms tesselating. 

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I would think of writing methods to create a hallway and to create a room and then I would create smaller methods that would help me accomplish those tasks.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A hallway is of width 1 and rooms are of width more than 1. Both contain walls and floors.
