                    <br>
                    Love is an indescribable feeling with you. I can not imagine experiencing
                    life without you by my side. I regularly think about all the memories that we have made
                    so far and all the memories that await us and I can't help but be happy and smile. It 
                    really does make me happy the happiest person in the world knowing that I have you by my 
                    side and that I get the honor of you being mine. Looking back at the last year and last two 
                    years even, it's crazy to think of where we are today. But I can't help but be happy 
                    about the way that things are working out and the place that we are in right now. I can not 
                    thank you enough for everything. You are the definition of my ride or die and there is no one 
                    that I would have rather spend my time with doing nothing or doing everything. I'm so excited about 
                    what is in store for us not just for the next year but for the rest of our lives. Thank you for 
                    everything, thank you for being you, thank you for being the best person and girlfriend in the world 
                    and thank you for always being up for any adventure. I'm so excited to continue making memories with you, 
                    as I cherish the ones that we have made so far so much. I can't wait for what's in store for us this next year. 
                    So cheers for year number two and to the rest of our lives.
